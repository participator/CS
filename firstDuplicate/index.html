    <h1>First Duplicate <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;">(as seen on <a href="https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice/task/pMvymcahZ8dY4g75q">CodeSignal</a>)</span></h1>
    <p>Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>For a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = 3.</p>

    <p>There are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3. The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.</p>

    <p>For a = [2, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = 2;</p>

    <p>For a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = -1.</p>
